----- Notes -----
Initially, I had written the code so that it supports subclasses of GameObject, for Rock,
Paper, and Scissor because of the constraints of the assignment. However, when I was almost
already done with the code, I realized how much better/concise I could code it and decided
to go down that route and write a more concise version, making it much easier to read and
making the code more optimized, since my game requires the switching of GameObject type.
In the current script that is running, I simply use the variable "Type" to switch between.
But in the old version, I had to remove and add a new subclass object.

If you want to see the subclasses version, please see script-old.js
